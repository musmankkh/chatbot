    "answer": "The sentiment analysis project detailed in the \"Sentiment Analysis Report.docx\" successfully developed a three-class sentiment classification model using the DistilBERT architecture, which is both efficient and effective for processing social media text. By fine-tuning the model on the Sentiment140 dataset, the project achieved strong accuracy and consistency in classifying sentiments as negative, neutral, or positive. The report outlines the model's architecture, training procedures, and evaluation metrics, emphasizing its ability to generalize well to unseen data. Additionally, a custom prediction function was implemented to allow users to input raw tweets and receive sentiment classifications along with confidence scores, enhancing the model's practical applicability for social media monitoring and opinion mining. Overall, the project highlights the effectiveness of transformer-based models in natural language processing tasks.",

    "question": "sentiment analysis",
    "answer": "Sentiment analysis is a core task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on determining the emotional tone conveyed by text. It involves automatically classifying written content into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. This capability is particularly important in the context of social media, where users express their thoughts and feedback in real time.\n\nIn the context of the provided documents, the sentiment analysis project aims to develop a three-class sentiment classification model using DistilBERT, a lightweight transformer architecture. The model categorizes text into three sentiment classes: negative, neutral, and positive. The project utilizes the Sentiment140 dataset, which contains 1.6 million tweets annotated for sentiment based on emoticons.\n\nKey components of the sentiment analysis project include:\n\n1. **Model Architecture**: The model is based on DistilBERT, which has approximately 66 million parameters and includes six transformer layers. An additional classification head is added to produce outputs for the three sentiment classes.\n\n2. **Objectives**: The primary objective is to accurately categorize text into the three sentiment classes. Secondary objectives include data preprocessing to clean and normalize tweet text.\n\n3. **Evaluation Metrics**: The project includes metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and per-class accuracy to assess model performance.\n\n4. **Custom Predictions**: A function is included to process new text inputs, providing predicted sentiment labels along with confidence scores and class probabilities.\n\nThe project successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for sentiment analysis, making it a valuable tool for applications like social media monitoring and opinion mining.\n\n**Sources**: \n- Sentiment Analysis Report.docx (sections: Introduction, Objective, Model Architecture, Conclusion)",
